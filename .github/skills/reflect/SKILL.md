# Reflection & Learning Skill

Use this skill when the user provides corrections (feedback) or when analyzing workflow patterns.

## Learned Corrections
- Language: Rust
- Shell Project: codecrafters-shell-rust
- Workflow: Prefer `git stash` over `git checkout` to preserve uncommitted work.
- Workflow: Run full test suite (`cargo test`) locally before every commit.
- Workflow: Write tests *before* finalizing feature implementation.
- Interaction: Explicitly propose destructive/irreversible actions (commit, push, overwrite) and await confirmation.
- Interaction: Pause execution immediately upon "No!" or alarm signals.
- Interaction: When correcting mistakes, explain the cause and proposed fix *before* executing it.
- Interaction: Distinguish between generative (code) and additive (docs) tasks; verify file state before writing to docs.
- Workflow: When implementing from remote specs, map interactive behaviors (e.g., "TAB press") to their underlying logic unit tests (e.g., "suggestion list generation") rather than function calling, as these are handled by `rustyline` library.
- Context: Acknowledge that implementing interactive features often requires iterative prompting to resolve API/visibility issues (e.g., `pub` structs, trait imports) that aren't immediately obvious.

## Capability: Reflect (Learn from Corrections)

When the user provides a correction (e.g., "No, do it this way", "Don't use X", "Remember to Y"):

1.  **Capture the Learning**: Summarize the user's correction into a concise rule.
2.  **Update Memory**: Append this rule to the "Learned Corrections" section in THIS file (`.github/skills/reflect/SKILL.md`).
3.  **Confirm**: Tell the user you have updated the reflection memory with the new correction.

## Capability: Reflect (Discover Patterns)

When the user asks to "reflect on skills" or if you notice the user repeating a complex workflow multiple times:

1.  **Analyze History**: Read the conversation history to identify repeated sequences of commands or requests (e.g., "build then test then run").
2.  **Synthesize**: Draft a new skill definition based on the observed pattern, including a name, description, and steps.
3.  **Propose**: Present the draft skill to the user for review.
4.  **Create**: Upon user approval, create the new Skill file (e.g., `.github/skills/new-workflow/SKILL.md`).
